# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

My website takes the user through a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. My website runs in  a browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean user interface and is responsive, and the format will adjust to accomodate multiple screen sizes.

Take a look at my website https://mcswajl.github.io/mcswajl-Gen-Random-Password/

Website Story
Again, this challenge was difficult for me because JavaScript is new to me and I am 
having a hard time remembering the correct functions, variables, arrays, etc. to use. (I said this in last weeks challenge, I'm struggling).
